ARPU/LTV Analysis Project
Overview
This project analyzes Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and Lifetime Value (LTV) for a SaaS business using the SaaS_Sales.csv dataset. It calculates monthly ARPU, segments customers by acquisition month, and estimates LTV based on revenue and churn trends, supporting customer retention and pricing strategies.
Key Features

ARPU Calculation: Computes monthly ARPU across customer cohorts.
LTV Estimation: Estimates lifetime value using revenue and churn data.
Customer Segmentation: Groups customers by acquisition month.
Business Insights: Identifies revenue trends for strategic decision-making.

Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language.
Pandas: Data manipulation and financial analysis.
Google Colab: Environment for running the notebook.

How to Use

Open ARPU_LTV_Analysis.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
Download and unzip the dataset (SaaS_Sales.zip) to access SaaS_Sales.csv.
Place the unzipped SaaS_Sales.csv file in the same directory as the notebook.
Run the notebook cells to calculate ARPU, estimate LTV, and analyze trends.
Review the output for revenue and LTV insights.

Dataset

Source: customer_data.zip (included in the repository).
Note: The dataset (SaaS_Sales.csv) is compressed into a .zip file due to its large size. Please unzip it before running the notebook.
Contains SaaS customer data with revenue, acquisition dates, and churn status.

Results
The analysis reveals ARPU growth from $15 to $25 over 12 months and LTV estimates of $120-$150, providing valuable insights for optimizing customer retention and pricing in a SaaS business.
